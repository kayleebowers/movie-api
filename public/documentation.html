    <h2>Endpoints in detail</h2>
    <h3>Return a list of ALL movies to the user</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using http://localhost:8080/movies will return an array of movie objects in JSON format. The method type is GET and has no response body. The query requires no parameters.</p>
      </div>
    <h3>Return data about a single movie by title to the user</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using http://localhost:8080/movies/:title will return a JSON object that includes information about a single movie. The method type is GET and has no response body. The query requires a movie title (Ex: Spirited Away) as a parameter written without quotation marks. An example of the URL with the parameter is http://localhost:8080/movies/Spirited%20Away.</p>
      </div>
    <h3>Return genre description by searching genre name/title</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using http://localhost:8080/genres/:name will return a JSON response. The method type is GET and has no response body. The query requires a genre name (Ex: Drama) as a parameter written without quotation marks. An example of the URL with the parameter is http://localhost:8080/genres/Drama, which would return the response, "In film and television, drama is a category or genre of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone."</p>
      </div>
    <h3>Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using http://localhost:8080/directors/:name will return a JSON object with the director information. The method type is GET and has no response body. The query requires a director name (Ex: "Steven Spielberg") as a parameter written without quotation marks. An example of the URL with the parameter is http://localhost:8080/directors/Steven%20Spielberg, which would return a JSON object with Steven Spielberg's information.</p>
      </div>
    <h3>Allow new users to register</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using http://localhost:8080/register with the POST method will return a JSON object showing the new user's information (as well as an automated ID). The response body must be a JSON object in the following format: 
          <code>{
            "Username": String,
            "Password": String,
            "Email": String,
            "Birthday": Date
        }</code>. The query requires no parameter. Entering a valid JSON object in the request body will return the JSON response object. An example of a valid entry is: 
        <code>{
          "Username": "NewUser",
          "Password": "543",
          "Email": "new@email.com",
          "Birthday": "1960-04-29"
      }</code>.
      </p>
      </div>
    <h3>Allow users to update their user info</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using localhost:8080/register/:Username/ with the PUT method will return a JSON object displaying all of the user's updated information. An already registered username is required as the parameter, and the request must include a request body in the following format: 
          <code>{
            Username: String,
            (required)
            Password: String,
            (required)
            Email: String,
            (required)
            Birthday: Date
          }</code>. 
          For example, localhost:8080/register/existingUser could have a request body as follows: 
          <code>{
            "Username": "existingUser",
            "Password": "newOne",
            "Email": "update@email.com",
            "Birthday": "2023-09-09"
          }</code>.
          A successful response returns all the existing user data, which will include the updated sections.

The query has no body but must include an existing username and a movie ID as parameters. The example http://localhost:8080/register/Coolkid/movies/649a271eef2156d71e630260 would return a JSON object displaying all of the user Coolkid's data, along with the new favorite movie.</p>
      </div> 
    <h3>Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using http://localhost:8080/favorites/:title with the DELETE method will return an HTML response: "The movie {title} has been deleted from your favorites." No response body is required. The query requires the movie title as a parameter. The example http://localhost:8080/favorites/12%20Angry$20Men would return an HTML response with "The movie "12 Angry Men" has been deleted from your favorites.</p>
      </div>
