    <h2>Endpoints in detail</h2>
    <h3>Return a list of ALL movies to the user</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using http://localhost:8080/movies will return an array of movie objects in JSON format. The method type is GET and has no response body. The query requires no parameters.</p>
      </div>
    <h3>Return data about a single movie by title to the user</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using http://localhost:8080/movies/:title will return a JSON object that includes information about a single movie. The method type is GET and has no response body. The query requires a movie title (Ex: Spirited Away) as a parameter written without quotation marks. An example of the URL with the parameter is http://localhost:8080/movies/Spirited%20Away.</p>
      </div>
    <h3>Return genre description by searching genre name/title</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using http://localhost:8080/genres/:name will return a JSON response. The method type is GET and has no response body. The query requires a genre name (Ex: Drama) as a parameter written without quotation marks. An example of the URL with the parameter is http://localhost:8080/genres/Drama, which would return the response, "In film and television, drama is a category or genre of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone."</p>
      </div>
    <h3>Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using http://localhost:8080/directors/:name will return a JSON object with the director information. The method type is GET and has no response body. The query requires a director name (Ex: "Steven Spielberg") as a parameter written without quotation marks. An example of the URL with the parameter is http://localhost:8080/directors/Steven%20Spielberg, which would return a JSON object with Steven Spielberg's information.</p>
      </div>
    <h3>Allow new users to register</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using http://localhost:8080/register with the POST method will return a JSON object showing the new user's information (as well as an automated ID). The response body must be a JSON object in the following format: 
          <code>{
            "Username": String,
            "Password": String,
            "Email": String,
            "Birthday": Date
        }</code>. The query requires no parameter. Entering a valid JSON object in the request body will return the JSON response object. An example of a valid entry is: 
        <code>{
          "Username": "NewUser",
          "Password": "543",
          "Email": "new@email.com",
          "Birthday": "1960-04-29"
      }</code>.
      </p>
      </div>
    <h3>Allow users to update their user info</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using localhost:8080/register/:Username/ with the PUT method will return a JSON object displaying all of the user's updated information. An already registered username is required as the parameter, and the request must include a request body in the following format: 
          <code>{
            Username: String,
            (required)
            Password: String,
            (required)
            Email: String,
            (required)
            Birthday: Date
          }</code>. 
          For example, localhost:8080/register/existingUser could have a request body as follows: 
          <code>{
            "Username": "existingUser",
            "Password": "newOne",
            "Email": "update@email.com",
            "Birthday": "2023-09-09"
          }</code>.
          A successful response returns all the existing user data, which will include the updated sections.
        </p>
      </div>
    <h3>Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using localhost:8080/register/:Username/movies/:MovieID with the POST method will return a JSON object with all of that user's data, including their expanded favorite movies list. The query has no body but must include an existing username and a movie ID as parameters. The example http://localhost:8080/register/Coolkid/movies/649a271eef2156d71e630260 would return a JSON object displaying all of the user Coolkid's data, along with the new favorite movie.</p>
      </div> 
    <h3>Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using http://localhost:8080/register/:Username/movies/:MovieID with the DELETE method will return a JSON object with the user's updated data. If they do not have the specified movie in their favorites list, the query will return "Movie ID not found." No response body is required. The query requires a username and movie ID as a parameter. The example http://localhost:8080/register/Coolkid/movies/649a2c62ef2156d71e630269 would return a JSON object with the user's updated data.</p>
      </div>
    <h3>Allow existing users to deregister</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Using http://localhost:8080/register/:Username with the DELETE method will return the HTML response: "{Username} was deleted." No response body is required. The query requires the username as a parameter. The example http://localhost:8080/register/Coolkid would return the HTML response,"Coolkid was deleted." If the username does not exist, it will instead return "{Username} was not found."</p>
